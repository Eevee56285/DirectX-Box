## What Is DirectX‑Box?

DirectX‑Box is a project aimed at recreating the classic **original Xbox experience** using modern tools.  
The goal isn’t to perfectly clone the original OS, but to capture its:

- Style  
- Personality  
- Atmosphere  
- Dashboard feel  
- Green techno‑organic vibe  

All while running on a flexible Linux foundation.

---

## Dashboard and Interface

The dashboard is the core of DirectX‑Box, powered by **[Theseus](https://github.com/MrMilenko/Theseus)** — a recreation of the original Xbox dashboard maintained by *MrMilenko*.

Theseus brings back:

- The iconic green glow  
- Original layout  
- Smooth transitions  
- The nostalgic Xbox vibe  

When the system boots, Theseus acts as the main shell, giving DirectX‑Box its identity.

> **Note:** This may change. It’s possible to dump an original Xbox OS to a hard‑drive image.  
> If that becomes the main method, Xemu may be the only component needed for dashboard functionality.

---

## Game Support and Compatibility

**[Xemu](https://xemu.app/)** is integrated directly into the system to run original Xbox games.  
Instead of feeling like a separate emulator, Xemu launches seamlessly from the dashboard.

Xemu handles:

- Game compatibility  
- Virtual hard drives  
- Memory units  
- System emulation  
- Smooth performance on modern hardware

## System Foundation (The Beloved Penguin)

DirectX‑Box runs on **Linux**, which provides:

- Stability  
- Hardware support  
- Flexibility  
- Driver management  
- Performance tuning  

This project currently uses **Ubuntu**, so you’ll see the Ubuntu installer and boot screen.

During installation:

- Set the **system name** to `xbox`  
- Keep all default settings  
- Enable **automatic login** when creating your password

---

## Features and Experience

DirectX‑Box aims to feel like a **real console**, not just Linux running an emulator.

Planned features include:

- Full dashboard experience  
- Game launching  
- System menus and settings  
- File browser  
- Theme support  
- Simple developer mode  
- Smooth integration between dashboard and emulator  

The goal is a cohesive, console‑like experience that brings the original Xbox back to life.

---

## Purpose and Inspiration

The original Xbox had a unique style — the green aesthetic, techno‑organic animations, sound effects, and overall vibe.  
DirectX‑Box brings that feeling back using modern hardware.

This is a passion project, not an official recreation.  
It mixes nostalgia with modern tech to revive the original Xbox experience while respecting what made it special.

# ❓ FAQ

### **What is DirectX‑Box?**
A Linux‑based system designed to recreate the look and feel of the original Xbox dashboard.

### **Is this an emulator?**
Not exactly.  
DirectX‑Box uses **Xemu** for game compatibility, but the goal is to make the entire system feel like a real console.

### **Does this use the real Xbox OS?**
Currently it uses **Theseus**, but dumping an original Xbox HDD image may change this in the future.

### **Can it read real Xbox discs?**
Not with modern disc drives.  
If someone creates a drive that can read Xbox discs, support *might* be added later.

### **What hardware does it run on?**
Anything that can run Ubuntu reliably:
- Laptops  
- Desktops  
- Mini PCs  
- Some handheld PCs  

### **Is this legal?**
DirectX‑Box itself is legal.  
Users are responsible for legally obtaining their own game files or BIOS dumps.

### **When will development continue?**
Full development begins this summer.

### **Can I contribute?**
Yes! Contributions, ideas, and testing feedback are welcome once the first public build is ready.

# Project Status

Development will begin over the summer.  
Until then, this GitHub page will serve as the main project hub.

---

# Todo List

- [x] Start the project  
- [ ] Fix Xemu integration and make it auto‑launch (in development)  
- [ ] Disc compatibility — **unlikely** due to modern disc drive limitations.  
      If someone creates a drive that can read Xbox discs, support *may* be added in the future.
